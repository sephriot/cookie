Application meant to open a file, allow select multiple shapes on it and save the results in a CSV file format.
All measurements are done in a pixel scale, so you will need a reference to translate them to real life measturement system.

## Why Cookie?

The name origin comes from my sister who needed such app to measure size of cell nucleus.
She was calling the cells "cookies" since they lookes much like cookies.
